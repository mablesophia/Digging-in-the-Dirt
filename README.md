The program can find and display the paths of all of the files in a directory and take action on some particular files

## Part 1: the program reads a line of input that specifies which files are eligible to be found ##
[x] D [path to a directory]
   *  print all the files in that directory
[x] R [path to a directory]
   *  print all the files in that directory, along with all of the files in its subdirectories, recursively
## Part 2: the program now reads a line of input that describes the search characteristics that will be used to decide whether files are "interesting" and should have action taken on them ##
